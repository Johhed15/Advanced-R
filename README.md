# This repository contains some of the work completed by me and another student during an advanced R course in my master's program!

- lab 2: Functions to solve simple problems with base R <br> 

## The following labs are created as packages which might make it a bit tricky to find the code, try looking in the "R"-map in each lab!  
<br>
- lab 3: Dijkstra and euclidean algorithm<br><br>
- lab 4: Two RC-class objects, one to do an linear regression and one for ridge regression<br><br>
- lab 5: A package to download data from an API and then genererate some graphs, a shiny app is also created here but is in a seperate repository named Shiny-BaDaAn<br><br>
- lab 6: Solving the knapsack problem with brute force, greedy heuristic and programming search<br><br>

<br>
